                            one rule may ultimately receive the request. Matching

                            Route type. * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
                            For example, a Route with a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08
                            01:02:03\" is given precedence over a Route with a creation
                            timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:04\". * If everything

                            order (namespace/name) should be given precedence. For
                            example, foo/bar is given precedence over foo/baz. \n

                            Route rule should be dropped to ensure consistency. For
                            example, even if a filter specified by a Route rule is
