## üëÄ Overview

[OpenFunction](https://openfunction.dev/) is a cloud-native open source FaaS (Function as a Service) platform aiming to let you focus on your business logic without having to maintain the underlying runtime environment and infrastructure. You only need to submit business-related source code in the form of functions.

<div align=center><img src=docs/images/function-lifecycle.svg></div>

OpenFunction features include:

- Cloud agnostic and decoupled with cloud providers' BaaS
- Pluggable architecture that allows multiple function runtimes
- Support both sync and async functions
- Unique async functions support that can consume events directly from event sources
- Support generating OCI-Compliant container images directly from function source code.
- Flexible autoscaling between 0 and N
- Advanced async function autoscaling based on event sources' specific metrics
- Simplified BaaS integration for both sync and async functions by introducing [Dapr](https://dapr.io/) 
- Advanced function ingress & traffic management powered by [K8s Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) (In Progress)
- Flexible and easy-to-use events management framework

## ‚ò∏ Architecture

![OpenFunction Architecture](docs/images/openfunction-0.5-architecture.svg)

OpenFunction manages resources in the form of Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) throughout the lifecycle of a function. To learn more about it, visit [Components](docs/concepts/Components.md) or [Concepts](https://openfunction.dev/docs/concepts/).

<div align=center><img src=docs/images/OpenFunction-events-architecture.svg></div>

OpenFunction Events is OpenFunction's events framework, you can refer to [OpenFunction Events](https://github.com/OpenFunction/OpenFunction/blob/main/docs/concepts/OpenFunction-events-framework.md) for more information.
## ‚úîÔ∏è Compatibility

### Kubernetes compatibility matrix

The following Kubernetes versions are supported as we tested against these versions in their respective branches. Besides, OpenFunction might also work well with other Kubernetes versions!

| OpenFunction                                                 | Kubernetes 1.17 | Kubernetes 1.18 | Kubernetes 1.19 | Kubernetes 1.20+ |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| [`release-0.4`](https://github.com/OpenFunction/OpenFunction/tree/v0.4.0) | &radic;         | &radic;         | &radic;         | &radic;          |
| [`release-0.5`](https://github.com/OpenFunction/OpenFunction/tree/v0.5.0) | &radic; *         | &radic; *         | &radic;         | &radic;          |
| [`release-0.6`](https://github.com/OpenFunction/OpenFunction/tree/v0.6.0) | &radic; *         | &radic; *         | &radic;         | &radic;          |

\****Note***: OpenFunction has added the [function ingress](docs/concepts/Components.md#domain) feature in *release-0.5*, which means that:

- You have to install OpenFunction in Kuberenetes ***v1.19*** or later if you enable this feature.
- You can still use OpenFunction in Kubernetes ***v1.17‚Äîv1.20+*** without this feature enabled.
