## üëÄ Overview

[OpenFunction](https://openfunction.dev/) is a cloud-native open source FaaS (Function as a Service) platform aiming to enable users to focus on their business logic without worrying about the underlying runtime environment and infrastructure. Users only need to submit business-related source code in the form of functions.

<div align=center><img src=docs/images/function-lifecycle.svg></div>

OpenFunction features but not limited to the following:

- Convert business-related function source code to runnable application source code.
- Generate a deployable container image from the converted application source code.
- Deploy the generated container image to the underlying runtime environment such as K8s, and automatically scale up and down according to business traffic, and scale to 0 when there is no traffic.
- Provide event management functions for trigger functions.
- Provide additional functions to manage function versions, ingress management etc.

## ‚ò∏ CustomResourceDefinitions

<div align=center><img src=docs/images/openfunction-overview.svg></div>

OpenFunction manages resources in the form of CustomResourceDefinitions (CRD) during the lifecycle of a function. You can learn more about it by visiting [Components](docs/concepts/Components.md) or [Concepts](https://openfunction.dev/docs/concepts/).

## ‚úîÔ∏è Compatibility

### Kubernetes compatibility matrix

The following versions are supported and work as we test against these versions in their respective branches. But note that other versions might work!

| OpenFunction                                                 | Kubernetes 1.17 | Kubernetes 1.18 | Kubernetes 1.19 | Kubernetes 1.20+ |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| [`release-0.3`](https://github.com/OpenFunction/OpenFunction/tree/v0.3.0) | &radic;         | &radic;         | &radic;         | &radic;          |
| [`release-0.4`](https://github.com/OpenFunction/OpenFunction/tree/v0.4.0) | &radic;         | &radic;         | &radic;         | &radic;          |
| [`HEAD`](https://github.com/OpenFunction/OpenFunction/tree/main) | &radic; *         | &radic; *         | &radic;         | &radic;          |

\****Note***: OpenFunction added the [function ingress](docs/concepts/Components.md#domain) feature after *release-0.4*, which means that:

1. You have to install OpenFunction in Kuberenetes ***v1.19*** or higher if you enable this feature.
2. You can still use OpenFunction in Kubernetes ***v1.17~v1.20+*** without this feature enabled.

## üöÄ QuickStart

### Install OpenFunction

You can use `ofn`, the CLI of OpenFunction, to install and uninstall OpenFunction and its dependencies.

Visit [ofn release](https://github.com/OpenFunction/cli/releases) to dowload the latest version of CLI and deploy it to your Kubernetes cluster.

```
wget -c  https://github.com/OpenFunction/cli/releases/download/v0.5.1/ofn_linux_amd64.tar.gz -O - | tar -xz
```

Make `ofn` executable and move it to `/usr/local/bin/`:

```
chmod +x ofn && mv ofn /usr/local/bin/
```

After that you can install OpenFunction with one command:

```
ofn install --all --version v0.5.0
```

For more information about ofn install, please refer to [ofn install docs](https://github.com/OpenFunction/cli/blob/main/docs/install.md).

### Sample: Run a function.

If you have already installed the OpenFunction platform, refer to [OpenFunction samples](https://github.com/OpenFunction/samples) to find more samples.

Here is an example of a sync function:

> This function will write "Hello, World!" to the HTTP response.

```go
package hello

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func HelloWorld(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprint(w, "Hello, World!\n")
}
```

[Function ingress](docs/concepts/Components.md#domain) defines an unified entry point for a sync function with which you can use to access a sync function without [configuring LB for knative](https://github.com/OpenFunction/samples/tree/main/functions/Knative/hello-world-go) like below:

```bash
curl http://<domain-name>.<domain-namespace>/<function-namespace>/<function-name>
```

And an async function example:

> This function will receive a greeting message and then send it to "another-target".

```go
package bindings

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"log"
  
	ofctx "github.com/OpenFunction/functions-framework-go/openfunction-context"
)

func BindingsOutput(ctx *ofctx.OpenFunctionContext, in []byte) ofctx.RetValue {
	log.Printf("receive greeting: %s", string(in))
	_ := ctx.Send("another-target", in)
	return 200
}
```

You can also use `ofn` to make a quick demo:

>By default the demo environment will be deleted when the demo finishes.
>You can keep the demo kind cluster for further exploration by `ofn demo --auto-prune=false`
>The demo kind cluster can be deleted by `kind delete cluster --name openfunction`

```shell
ofn demo
```

For more information about ofn install, please refer to [ofn demo docs](https://github.com/OpenFunction/cli/blob/main/docs/demo.md).

### Uninstall OpenFunction

Use `ofn` to uninstall OpenFunction and its dependencies:

```shell
ofn uninstall --all
```

For more information about ofn install, please refer to [ofn uninstall docs](https://github.com/OpenFunction/cli/blob/main/docs/uninstall.md).
